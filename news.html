            <h1>U.S. Embassy, Sri Lanka’s Maritime Archaeology Unit dive to ancient Godawaya shipwreck</h1>
            <p id="date"> March 29, 2024</p>
            <img src="assets/media/news/image/news 1/2.jpg" class="center">
            <p>The Colombo U.S. Embassy, in partnership with the Central Cultural Fund’s
                 Maritime Archaeology Unit, has undertaken a step in preserving Sri Lanka’s
                  rich maritime history through the conservation and documentation of the Godawaya shipwreck, 
                  the oldest known shipwreck in the Asia-Pacific region. This initiative, funded by the U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation, underscores the enduring partnership between the United States and Sri Lanka in cultural preservation and archaeological research.</p>
               <p>U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Julie Chung, along with Heidi Hattenbach,
                 Counsellor for Public Affairs at the U.S. Embassy, and Senior Archeology Officer of the Central 
                 Cultural Fund’s Maritime Archaeology Unit Rasika Muthucumarana, led an inspection dive 
                 to the ancient Godawaya shipwreck off the coast of Hambantota. This venture is part of a broader effort supported by the U.S. Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation, which began funding the project in
                 2022 to study and safeguard the submerged cultural treasure dating back to the 2nd Century B.C.</p>
                 <p>Ambassador Chung expressed the importance of the mission, stating, “Witnessing the Godawaya shipwreck firsthand at 33 metres below the surface of the ocean was a breathtaking experience, shedding light on Sri Lanka’s significant history as a pivotal maritime hub. The United States is proud to support this endeavour, enhancing the understanding of Sri Lanka’s historical role in global maritime trade and ensuring the preservation of its rich cultural legacy for future generations.”
    
                    Through funding support of the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation, 
                    the Maritime Archaeology Unit (MAU) has been able to safeguard nearly 200
                     artifacts unearthed from the wreck, ranging from clay pottery to metal objects 
                     and intricate carnelian beads. As the project progresses, the MAU is on track to 
                     develop a complete 3D model of the entire shipwreck site, a milestone that promises 
                     to revolutionize the field of maritime archaeology and cultural preservation in Sri Lanka. 
                     The artifacts removed from the shipwreck will be on display in Colombo at the end of the year, 
                     and then will eventually be housed in a permanent exhibit at the Maritime Archaeology Museum in 
                     Galle for Sri Lankans and tourists to visit, view, and learn about the country’s rich history.
                      The AFCP will also fund an education programme that will bring opportunities to learn from the
                       Godawaya project
                     to schools and students close to the dive site.</p>

                         <p> The largest inscription ever in Sri Lanka, found from the Dimbulagala Monastery grounds, 
                            belongs to the beginning of the second centrury BC or earlier than that, Sri Jayawardenapura University History and Archaeology professor Karunasena Hettiarachchi said.
                                Addressing the media, he said 60 percent of this inscription was unreadable and 40 percent was readable
                                "This inscription was written in Brahmi characters. We found that 24 Brahmi characters were used on the inscription. At least 1,000 characters were used. Moreover, there are several rare symbols, 
                                which have never been seen by officials through their previous inscriptions," he said.
                                According to the signs, characters, and unique symbols, the committee had decided to announce that the inscription belonged to the beginning of the second centrum BC or earlier than that.                    
                                The Polonnaruwa Archeology Office found the largest inscription ever found in the country on July 10, 2023,
                                 at the Dimbulagala Monastery grounds.                      
                                Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Ministry Secretary Somaratne Vidanapathirana, said that eleven expert committee members, comprising Vice President of the Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka Archaeologists, specialized in epigraphy, Ms. Malini Dias and Prof. Karunasena Hettiarachchi, were appointed on January 17, 2024, to issue a report after exploring a 45-feet-long and 18-feet-high inscription.
                                The inscription was recovered by the villagers of Dimbulagala. Accordingly, initial steps in exploring the inscription were completed on November 18, 2023, Vidanapathirana said. 
                                Meanwhile, Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs Minister Vidura Wickramanayaka, told the media that the printed copies of the inscription should be available to the public and that they must conduct more studies to reveal the history.

                <h1>Pioneering Sri Lanka’s Archaeological Identity</h1>
                <p id="date">February 10, 2024</p>
                <img src="assets/media/news/image/news 3/Pioneering.jpg" class="center">
                <p>Archaeological excavations cannot be done using heavy machinery such as excavators or bulldozers. It should be done very carefully and with much concentration.
            
                    Once, in an excavation site, an employer was excavating the earth with the help of a pickaxe. He was trying to recover a clay vessel from the earth. But, the edge of the vessel was damaged by the pickaxe. As the Commissioner of Archaeology approached the place, the employee tried to fix the piece with some saliva. He could stick the piece to the vessel so that he could temporarily cover the damage.
                     The commissioner asked the employee to recover the vessel carefully.</p>
                   <p>This employee should be actually appreciated because of his disciplined behaviour. He was not really afraid of the damage done to the vessel. Still, he had great respect towards the commissioner as he knew that the vessel he had discovered could be critical evidence in the archaeological research. This commissioner of archaeology was Dr. Charles Godakumbura. He died on February 10, 1977, in Myanmar.
            
                    Today, excavation works are conducted using modern technology. For this purpose, a developed apparatus is used. Today, Sri Lanka has been able to claim for the service of some talented young archaeologists. If they are trained and guided in the proper way, they would also perform some great services like their predecessors such as Prof. 
                    Senerat Paranavitana and Dr. Charles Godakumbura</p>
                    <p>The discipline of exploring archaeological treasures, which Prof. Senerat Paranavitana had displayed, was continued by Dr. Charles Godakumbura to a certain extent. To become well-proficient in a subject like archaeology, one must have a thorough knowledge of language and literature, archaeological data, and fieldwork. Dr. Charles Godakumbura had been well-equipped with these qualities. His predecessors were H. C. P. Bell, Hokart, and Prof. Paranavitana.
            
                        After Prof. Paranavitana, Dr Godakumbura became one of the prominent commissioners of archaeology in Sri Lanka. When Prof. Paranavitana was appointed Commissioner of Archaeology, Pandit Munidasa Kumaratunga said, “Some brighten their positions. But because of Prof. Senerat Paranavitana, his position brightens.”
                        
                        The same comments can be attributed to Dr Charles Godakumbura. He was not only the chief of a department. However, he was an expert in several subjects such as languages, literature, sculpture, arts, etc. He displayed his knowledge in these fields so that he was entitled to be involved in archaeology and other subjects. He categorised all his knowledge in one book, ‘Sashtriya Lipi and Katha’ (Classical Articles and Speeches). It was published in 1971.
                        
                        
                        His service expanded to many areas – writing books, encouraging others to write books, reorganising reorganise his department’s works, improving the human resources of his department, etc.</p>

                        <p>The Director General of the Department of Archaeology, Professor Anura Manatunga has stepped down from his position, Minister of Buddhasasana, Religious and Cultural Affairs, Vidura Wickramanayaka said today.
                
                            Minister Vidura Wickramanayaka stated that Prof. Manatunga has submitted a letter to the Secretary of the Ministry, informing his decision to resign.
                            
                            However, the reason for Prof. Manatunga’s resignation is unclear.
                            
                            Prof. Manatunga’s resignation comes days after a meeting between President Ranil Wickremesinghe and officials from the Department of Archaeology. 
                            
                            The matter of the acquisition of excess land by the Department of Archaeology in the North and East was raised during the meeting convened last week (08).
                            
                            President Ranil Wickremesinghe called out officials of the Department of Archaeology over the acquisition of excess land under the pretext of heritage properties. 
                            
                            At the discussion, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) MPs pointed out the acquisition of lands belonging to the public in the Northern and Eastern Province by the Department, including in the Thannimurippu and Thiriyaya areas.
                            
                            Upon being inquired on the matter, the President informed officials from the Archaeology Department to follow Cabinet policy and to refrain from seizing lands belonging to the public. 
                            
                            In an exchange of words with the Department officials, the President also inquired whether he was to provide history lessons to educate them, while he then proceeded to explain the placing of border marker stones in ancient times.
                            
                            While emphasizing the need to protect ancient temples in Sri Lanka, the President issued directives to the officials of the Archaeology Department to remove border marker stones which 
                            are being used as a reason to acquire public-owned land. (NewsWire)</p>

                                The arrest follows a police complaint from the Archaeology Department which says that under the Antiquities Ordinance, “insulting an archaeological monument is similar to causing damage to an archaeological monument”.
                                
                                Prof. Manatunga said that in the statement to the police, department officials would explain the Ordinance and its violation</p>
